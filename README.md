# Data-Bootcamp-Final-Personalized-Diet-Recommendation-System

Hello! This project explores the use of machine learning to predict recommended meal plans based on user-specific data. The dataset I use is from Kaggle and features patient health profiles, with data on demographic and physiological features such as age, BMI, fat and protein intake, and dietary habits. My goal is to train predictive models that can classify individuals into one of several meal plan categories: Balanced, High-Protein, Low-Carb, or Low-Fat diets. Multiple algorithms — including logistic regression, decision trees, K-nearest neighbors, and neural networks — are evaluated to determine which best captures the complex, potentially nonlinear relationships between personal traits and dietary recommendations.
